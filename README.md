Process OpenPaths json data to create a data structure of place nodes, behavior networks, and common trips.

In progress. Includes multiple visualization types.

"... i have resorted to the category of "trajectory". it was
intended to suggest a temporal movement through space,
that is, the unity of diachronic *succession* of points through
which it passes, and not the *figure* that these points form
on a space that is supposed to be synchronic or achronic.
Indeed, this "representation" is insufficient, precisely because a
trajectory is drawn, and time and movement are thus reduced to a line that
can be seized as a whole by the eye and read in a single moment, as one
projects onto a map the path taken by someone walking through a
city. however useful this "flattening out" may be, it transforms the
*temporal* articulation of places into a *spatial* sequence of 
points. a graph takes the place of an operation. a reversible sign
(one that can be read in both directions, once it is projected onto
a map) is substituted for a practice indissociable from particular
moments and "opportunities", and this irreversible (one cannot
go backward in time, or have another chance at missed opportunities).
it is thus a mark *in place of* acts, a relic in place of
performances: it is only their remainder, the sign of their erasure.
such a projection postulates that it is possible to take the
one (the mark) for the other (operations articulated on occasions).
this is the quid pro quo typical of the reductions which a functionalist 
administration of space must make in order to be effective."
